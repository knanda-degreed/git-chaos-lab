# ‚úÇÔ∏è Lab 4: Squash and Merge Lost Credit

In this lab, you‚Äôll simulate what happens when GitHub‚Äôs ‚ÄúSquash and Merge‚Äù feature rewrites commit history ‚Äî and how contributor authorship can be lost.

Then you‚Äôll fix it using interactive rebase and `--author`.

---

## üß≠ Scenario

- Two teammates contribute to a branch
- The maintainer squashes and merges their work into `main`
- Now Git log shows the squasher as the only author
- You‚Äôll learn how to fix or avoid this

---

## üéØ Goal

Practice:
- Making multiple commits as different authors
- Squashing via `rebase -i`
- Editing commit authorship
- Preserving contribution credit

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

Start from this lab:
```bash
git checkout lab4-start
```

Create a new branch and simulate multiple authors:
```bash
git checkout -b feature-authors
echo "Line from Alice" > file.txt
git add . && git commit -m "Alice's work" --author="Alice <alice@example.com>"

echo "Line from Bob" >> file.txt
git commit -am "Bob's work" --author="Bob <bob@example.com>"
```

---

## ‚úÇÔ∏è Squash and Merge

Simulate what GitHub does:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge --squash feature-authors
git commit -m "Squashed feature work"
```

Now run:
```bash
git log --pretty=full
```

‚ùó Only one author remains.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Fix It with Rebase

Instead of squashing like that, try:

```bash
git checkout feature-authors
git rebase -i HEAD~2
```

Change:
```
pick abc123 Alice's work
pick def456 Bob's work
```
to:
```
pick abc123 Alice's work
squash def456 Bob's work
```

You‚Äôll be prompted to merge messages. After that:

```bash
git commit --amend --author="Alice and Bob <team@example.com>"
```

Or list both in message body as contributors.

---

## ‚úÖ Done!

You now understand how squash merge rewrites history ‚Äî and how to preserve contributor credit manually.
